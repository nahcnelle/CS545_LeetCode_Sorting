This is my submission for CS545 Sorting LeetCode Problems. 
Each method in LeetCodeSolutions.java is a solution to one fo the problems completed, which are problems #88, 905, and 1122.

Problem #88: Merged Sorted Array
This problem gives two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, and their sizes, m and n, and asks to merge the two in order into nums1.

Problem #905: Sort Array By Parity
This problem gives an unsorted array and asks to return an array with all even numbers at the beginning of the array, followed by all the odd numbers.

Problem #1122: Relative Sort Array
This problem gives two arrays, arr1 and arr2, where the elements in arr2 are distinct and a subset of arr1. 
It asks to return an array with elements from arr1 sorted in the same relative order as the elements in arr2,
with elements not found in arr2 placed in the array in ascending order at the end.
